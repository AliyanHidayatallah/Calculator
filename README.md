# Aliyan's Calculator

Welcome to my Calculator project! This simple yet functional calculator is designed with a clean and sleek interface, making it easy to perform basic arithmetic operations. Let's dive into the details of how I coded this project.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The calculator is built with a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.
- **Clear Display:** The calculator features a display area where the input and results are shown in a large font, making it easy to read.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using the corresponding buttons.
- **Decimal Handling:** The calculator intelligently handles decimal input, preventing multiple decimals in a single number.
- **Clear and Delete Buttons:** The 'AC' button clears the entire display, and 'DE' (Delete) removes the last entered digit.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) is well-organized with a simple structure. The calculator is enclosed within a container div, providing a clean and centered layout. The calculator itself is represented by a form, and the display is an input field within that form.

I have utilized JavaScript to create the dynamic behavior of the calculator. The `addToDisplay` function is responsible for updating the display when buttons are clicked, ensuring proper handling of input.

## CSS Styling

My choice of styling creates an aesthetically pleasing calculator. Here are some key points about the CSS:

- **Font:** The 'Poppins' font is used throughout the calculator, contributing to a modern and clean appearance.
- **Color Scheme:** The color scheme is a combination of shades of green and white, providing a visually appealing contrast.
- **Button Styling:** The calculator buttons are styled with rounded corners, a subtle box-shadow, and appropriate spacing, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Operator Button Color:** Operator buttons have a distinct color (`#A59079`), making them easily identifiable.

## How to Use

1. Enter numbers using the numeric buttons.
2. Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) for arithmetic operations.
3. Press the '=' button to calculate the result.
4. 'AC' clears the display, and 'DE' removes the last entered digit.
5. Decimal point can be added using the '.' button.
